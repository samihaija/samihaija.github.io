title: "Watch Your Step: Learning Node Embeddings via Graph Attention"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2018-wys
excerpt: 'Combines the two-step node embedding process of DeepWalk, consisting of random walk simulation the word-embedding learning, into one step, that allows us to push gradients for updating the context distribution that corresponds to the probability mass that each node assigns to its neighbors utilized during the walk sampling.'
