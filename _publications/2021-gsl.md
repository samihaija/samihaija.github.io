excerpt: 'Can synthesize simple images with novel attribute combinations. E.g. having seen "red trucks" and "blue boats" our method could synthesize "blue truck" (or "red boat") even if these combinations are not presented during training. The latent space is disentangled among attributes by designing an auto-encoder that "swaps" latent subspaces during training.'
